HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's a stateless, application-layer protocol for communicating between distributed systems, and is the foundation of the modern web.
HTTP allows for communication between a variety of hosts and clients, and supports a mixture of network configurations. To make this possible, it assumes very little about a particular system, and does not keep state between different message exchanges. This makes HTTP a stateless protocol. The communication usually takes place over TCP/IP, but any reliable transport can be used.
At the heart of web communications is the request message, which are sent via Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Protocol is typically http, but it can also be https for secure communications. With URLs and verbs, the client can initiate requests to the server. In return, the server responds with status codes and message payloads. The status code is important and tells the client how to interpret the server response. The HTTP spec defines certain number ranges for specific types of responses
2xx: Successful, this tells the client that the request was successfully processed. The most common code is 200 OK. For a GET request, the server sends the resource in the message body. There are other less frequently used codes. 202 Accepted: the request was accepted but may not include the resource in the response. This is useful for async processing on the server side. The server may choose to send information for monitoring.
204 No Content: there is no message body in the response.
205 Reset Content: indicates to the client to reset its document view.
206 Partial Content: indicates that the response only contains partial content. Additional headers indicate the exact range and content expiration information.
3xx: Redirection, this requires the client to take additional action. The most common use-case is to jump to a different URL in order to fetch the resource.
301 Moved Permanently: the resource is now located at a new URL.
303 See Other: the resource is temporarily located at a new URL. The Location response header contains the temporary URL.
304 Not Modified: the server has determined that the resource has not changed and the client should use its cached copy. This relies on the fact that the client is sending ETag (Enttity Tag) information that is a hash of the content. The server compares this with its own computed ETag to check for modifications.
4xx: Client Error, these codes are used when the server thinks that the client is at fault, either by requesting an invalid resource or making a bad request. The most popular code in this class is 404 Not Found, which I think everyone will identify with. 404 indicates that the resource is invalid and does not exist on the server. The other codes in this class include: 
400 Bad Request: the request was malformed.
401 Unauthorized: request requires authentication. The client can repeat the request with the Authorization header. If the client already included the Authorization header, then the credentials were wrong.
403 Forbidden: server has denied access to the resource.
405 Method Not Allowed: invalid HTTP verb used in the request line, or the server does not support that verb.
409 Conflict: the server could not complete the request because the client is trying to modify a resource that is newer than the client's timestamp. Conflicts arise mostly for PUT requests during collaborative edits on a resource.
5xx: Server Error, this class of codes are used to indicate a server failure while processing the request. The most commonly used error code is 500 Internal Server Error. The others in this class are:
501 Not Implemented: the server does not yet support the requested functionality.
503 Service Unavailable: this could happen if an internal system on the server has failed or the server is overloaded. Typically, the server won't even respond and the request will timeout.
Domain names are human versions of IP addresses. Computer sends request to resolver or internet service provider and finally land on a root server. The root server then lands on the .com top level domain.
