In software engineering, an Architectural Pattern is a general and reusable solution to an occurring problem in a particular context. It is a recurring solution to a recurring problem. The purpose of Architectural Patterns is to understand how the major parts of the system fit together and how messages and data flow through the system. Architectural Patterns are similar to Design Patterns, but they have a different scope. Architectural Patterns are high-level strategies that concern large-scale components, the global properties and mechanisms of a system.
