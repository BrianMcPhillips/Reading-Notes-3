In software engineering, an Architectural Pattern is a general and reusable solution to an occurring problem in a particular context. It is a recurring solution to a recurring problem. The purpose of Architectural Patterns is to understand how the major parts of the system fit together and how messages and data flow through the system. Architectural Patterns are similar to Design Patterns, but they have a different scope. Architectural Patterns are high-level strategies that concern large-scale components, the global properties and mechanisms of a system.
Architectural Style is a name given to a recurrent Architectural Design. It doesnâ€™t exist to solve a problem. A single architecture can contain several Architectural Styles, and each Architectural Style can make use of several Architectural Patterns. An Idiom is a low-level pattern specific to a programming language. It describes how to implement particular aspects of the components or the relationships between them using the features of a given language. Containers are statful components that contain your business login. 
Presentations are stateless components that present your data. When the Container/Presentation pattern first became popular all containers were class based components. At that time state and lifecycle methods were only available within class components. Since containers are responsible for managing state and fetching data (lifecycle methods) they were exclusively written as class components. This helped highlight the dichotomy between container components (classes) and presentational components (functions).
A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element.
