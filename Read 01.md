A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.The three states of a promise are: Pending, initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. Fulfilled meaning that the operation completed successfully. Rejected, meaning that the operation failed. Promises can also be chained.
Spread syntax allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.
Rest parameters, the rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. Rest parameters are only the ones that haven't been given a separate name (i.e. formally defined in function expression), while the arguments object contains all arguments passed to the function.
