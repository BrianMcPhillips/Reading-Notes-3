Modern web applications need to provide a level of security for their users storing sensitive information in to their databases. Some information can be stored as plain text behind a firewall or in a password protected database, other more sensitive data needs to be stored in a ecrypted hashing aligorithm. This prevents everyone including developers with database access from getting passwords. Sensitive data should never be sent to a client application.
Cryptography is the science which studies methods for encoding messages so that they can be read only by a person who knows the secret information required for decoding, called the key; it includes cryptanalysis, the science of decoding encrypted messages without possessing the proper key, and has several other branches.
A Cryptographic Hash Algorithm takes a piece of data and produces a hash that is deliberately difficult to reverse. If identical data is passed into the algorithm the same hash will always be produced. Hash algorithms are often used for checking the integrity of data. In a User model, a hash password can be stored when the user signs up. When the user needs to login, they can resend their password and the server can hash the login password using the same hash algorithm. The server can then compare the hashed login password with previously stored hashed password to determine if the user should be authenticated.
A Cryptographic Cypher Algorithm takes a piece of data and a key and produces encrypted data. Later the encrypted data can be reversed into the original data by decrypting it using the same key. User tokens can be created by associated a random unique string (tokenSeed) with a user account and, in turn, encrypting the tokenSeed with a secret key that only the server knows. We can then send the encrypted token to a client application. When the client makes a future request they send back the token. The server can reverse the token into the tokenSeed by decrypting it with the secret key. This is because the tokenSeed was unique to the database and can be queried to produce the user who made the request.
Basic Authorization is a common method used to send a username and password in an HTTP request. The username and password are joined with a ‘:’ then “base64 encoded” and placed after the string ‘Basic ‘. The resulting string is set to the value of an Authorization header. A Server can decode the Basic Authorization header to retrieve the username and password. If the combination is validated, the server generally responds back to the client with some sort of validation response (token or key) so that the client can re-authenticate without having to continually send the username:password combination in plain text over the internet.
In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic <credentials>, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon :.
