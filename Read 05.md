Javascript is a simple and modern language that was initially created to add dynamic behavior to websites inside the browser. When a website is loaded, Javascript is run by the browser's Javascript Engine and converted into a bunch of code that the computer can understand. For Javascript to interact with your browser, the browser provides a Runtime Environment.
HTTP clients are tools capable of sending a request to a server and then receive a response from it. Almost every tool that will be discussed uses an HTTP client under the hood, to query the server of the website that you will attempt to scrape.
Request is one of the most widely used HTTP clients in the Javascript ecosystem, however, though currently, the author of the Request library has officially declared that it is deprecated. This does not mean it is unusable, quite a lot of libraries still use it, and it is every bit worth using. It is fairly simple to make an HTTP request with Request.
The simplest way to get started with web scraping without any dependencies is to use a bunch of regular expressions on the HTML string that you receive by querying a webpage using an HTTP client, but there is a big tradeoff. Regular Expressions aren't as flexible and quite a lot of people both professionals and amateurs struggle with writing the correct regular expression.
