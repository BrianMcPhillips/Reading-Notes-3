In a typical React application, data is passed top-down via props, but this can be cumbersome for certain types of props that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.
Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. The Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider. One Provider can be connected to many consumers. Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree. All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Provider’s value prop changes.
