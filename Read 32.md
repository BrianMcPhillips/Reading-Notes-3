In a typical React application, data is passed top-down via props, but this can be cumbersome for certain types of props that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.
