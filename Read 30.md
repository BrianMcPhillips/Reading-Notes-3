Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. 
Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes. React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components. We’ll look at the built-in Hooks first. The Effect Hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API. When you call useEffect, you’re telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its props and state. Effects may also optionally specify how to “clean up” after them by returning a function. Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic, not state itself. If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.
During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState). The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component. The initialState argument is the state used during the initial render. In subsequent renders, it is disregarded. If the initial state is the result of an expensive computation, you may provide a function instead, which will be executed only on the initial render. Often, effects create resources that need to be cleaned up before the component leaves the screen, such as a subscription or timer ID. To do this, the function passed to useEffect may return a clean-up function.
