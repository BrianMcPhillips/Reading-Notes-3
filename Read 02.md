Clean Code, clean code and bad code can make or break a company. When you rush a product to market and find yourself wading through bad code to add features, fix bugs, and produce new versions; you will see that bad code with tons of 'WTF's" per minute will be the downfall of your company. Bad code will cause newer versions to crash and contain lots of bugs. Bad code may work, but makes it impossible for you to revisit the code that you've written and be able to tell what is happening with the code. Bad code is like tying a complicated knot and then trying to add more strings to the knot. You end up cutting strings to untie the knot which breaks features that were previously working. When adding features to bad code you can create a new features which breaks three or four of the old features. This can cause productivity to slow down until developers demand for a complete redisgn of the existing code base. The product management team will bring in a new team of developers who will be in a race with the current team to dispatch a new code base that works exactly like the old one. Clean code can easily turn into bad code from slapping modules together in a rush, and while the customer and the product manager may want a faster timetable it is on you the developer to defend your timeline for creating clean and scalable code. Clean code is about having code sense, being able to look at messy code and see a list of options or variables that still achieve the same goal. Bad code tries to do too much and clean code should be focused. One module or class to accomplish a single task that will not be disturbed by other modules or classes. Clean code should have meaningful names and should be easy for another person to enhance it later on. Clean code should also be based on the principle of test driven development. Clean code should not duplicate itself.
Array methods, forEach this method can help you to loop over array's items. It elimates the messy work of a for loop. includes, this method check if array includes the item passed in the method.filter, this method create new array with only elements passed condition inside the provided function. map, this method create new array by calling the provided function in every element. reduce this method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
Class, classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 classalike semantics. An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not. You first need to declare your class and then access it. When a static or prototype method is called without a value for this, such as by assigning a variable to the method and then calling it, the this value will be undefined inside the method. This behavior will be the same even if the "use strict" directive isn't present, because code within the class body's syntactic boundary is always executed in strict mode.
Model View Controller,  is a predictable software design pattern that can be used across many frameworks with many programming languages, commonly Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, and more. It is popularly used to design web applications and mobile apps
