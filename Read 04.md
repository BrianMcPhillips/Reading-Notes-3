PostgreSQL join is used to combine columns from one (self-join) or more tables based on the values of the common columns between related tables. The common columns are typically the primary key columns of the first table and foreign key columns of the second table.
PostgreSQL supports inner join, left join, right join, full outer join, cross join, natural join, and a special kind of join called self-join.
The inner join examines each row in the first table (basket_a). It compares the value in the fruit_a column with the value in the fruit_b column of each row in the second table (basket_b). If these values are equal, the inner join creates a new row that contains columns from both tables and adds this new row the result set.
The right join is a reversed version of the left join. The right join starts selecting data from the right table. It compares each value in the fruit_b column of every row in the right table with each value in the fruit_a column of every row in the fruit_a table.
In systems analysis, a one-to-one relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities (see also entity–relationship model) A and B in which one element of A may only be linked to one element of B, and vice versa. In mathematical terms, there exists a bijective function from A to B. For instance, think of A as the set of all human beings, and B as the set of all their brains. Any person from A can and must have only one brain from B, and any human brain in B can and must belong to only one person that is contained in A.
In a relational database, a one-to-one relationship exists when one row in a table may be linked with only one row in another table and vice versa. It is important to note that a one-to-one relationship is not a property of the data, but rather of the relationship itself. A list of mothers and their children may happen to describe mothers with only one child, in which case one row of the mothers table will refer to only one row of the children table and vice versa, but the relationship itself is not one-to-one, because mothers may have more than one child, thus forming a one-to-many relationship.
In systems analysis, a one-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities (see also entity–relationship model) A and B in which an element of A may be linked to many elements of B, but a member of B is linked to only one element of A. For instance, think of A as books, and B as pages. A book can have many pages, but a page can only be in one book.
In a relational database, a one-to-many relationship exists when one row in table A may be linked with many rows in table B, but one row in table B is linked to only one row in table A. It is important to note that a one-to-many relationship is not a property of the data, but rather of the relationship itself. A list of authors and their books may happen to describe books with only one author, in which case one row of the books table will refer to only one row of the authors table, but the relationship itself is not one-to-many, because books may have more than one author, forming a many-to-many relationship.
