React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components. Some components don't know their children ahead of time. This is commmon for components like sidebar or dialog that represent boxes. Use special children to pass elements directly into the output. Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a componentâ€™s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions. To use non UI functionality extract it into a separate javascript module.
