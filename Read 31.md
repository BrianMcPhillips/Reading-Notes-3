Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions. Traditionally in React, we’ve had two popular ways to share stateful logic between components: render props and higher-order components. When we want to share logic between two JavaScript functions, we extract it to a third function. Both components and Hooks are functions, so this works for them too. A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks. There’s nothing new inside of it — the logic is copied from the components above. Just like in a component, make sure to only call other Hooks unconditionally at the top level of your custom Hook. Unlike a React component, a custom Hook doesn’t need to have a specific signature. We can decide what it takes as arguments, and what, if anything, it should return. In other words, it’s just like a normal function. Custom Hooks offer the flexibility of sharing logic that wasn’t possible in React components before. You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers.
First released in October of 2018, the React hook APIs provide an alternative to writing class-based components, and offer an alternative approach to state management and lifecycle methods. The easiest way to describe Hooks is to show side-by-side examples of a class component that needs to have access to state and lifecycle methods, and another example where we achieve the same thing with a functional component. Hooks have a lot of benefit to us as developers, and they are going to change the way we write components for the better.
Array manipulation is what a dev goes through every weekday. Adding elements to an array or removing an element at a given index is a daily routine for us. useArray reduces this burden by providing us with various array manipulation methods. Forms are everywhere, even in the smallest of applications we have to encounter forms and manage their state. Managing form state in React can be a bit unwieldy sometimes.
