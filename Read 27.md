React components can, and often do, have state. State can be anything, but think of things like whether a user is logged in or not and displaying the correct username based on which account is active. React components with state render UI based on that state. When the state of components changes, so does the component UI. The reconciliation process is the way React updates the DOM, by making changes to the component based on the change in state. When the request to setState() is triggered, React creates a new tree containing the reactive elements in the component. The rule of thumb is to never mutate state directly. Always use setState() to change state. Modifying state directly, like the snippet below will not cause the component to re-render.
